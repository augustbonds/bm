# bm - The git-backed bookmark tool
Bm is a simple python 2.7-script that allows you to store and manipulate bookmarks in a lose-nothing git repository. It utilizes the history-preserving aspect of git to allow for "removal" of outdated bookmarks, without actually losing them.

# How to run bm?
Currently, it has only been tested on python 2.7 on MacOS. Simply download the 'bm' script and place it in a directory on your path.
